                The IGI Healthy Campus Initiative is an investigation into preventative measures being taken to protect
                on-campus employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study’s Principal Investigators are Prof.
                Jennifer Doudna, PhD (Executive Director, Innovative Genomics Institute) and Dr. Guy Nicolette, MD
                (Assistant Vice Chancellor for University Health Services), and the study coordinator is Alexander
                Ehrenberg (PhD Student, Dept. of Integrative Biology).

                <p className='lead'>Executive Summary</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You are being invited to participate in this study because you have been approved for on-campus
                        work at UC Berkeley between June 2020 and January 2021.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The specific purpose of this study is to model and evaluate the efficacy of asymptomatic testing and
                        automated contact tracing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the campus population.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For this study, you will give saliva samples at campus kiosks every other week which will be tested in
                        a COVID-19 diagnostics lab. These tests are not FDA approved so if they return a positive or
                        inconclusive result, you will be directed to confirmatory testing at University Health Services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your participation in this study is optional and will not affect your ability to return to work on
                        campus or receive symptomatic testing for COVID-19 by University Health Services.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p className='lead'>Procedures</p>
                <p>
                    If you agree to participate in this study, you will be given access to regular (bi-weekly) saliva-based
                    COVID-19 testing set up to test exclusively asymptomatic individuals. You will schedule visits to testing
                    kiosks spread throughout the UC Berkeley campus using an online scheduling application every two
                    weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the scheduling you will be asked several brief questions. At the testing kiosk you will need to
                    present your ID and confirmation email. At the kiosk, you will spit into a tube while being watched by
                    kiosk personnel. You will then return the tube to the personnel. This sample will be brought to the IGI
                    SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics lab for testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The procedure at the testing site will take 5-10 minutes each visit. In total, for the duration of this study,
                    you can expect to spend a total of roughly 2 hours for the asymptomatic testing. You can opt out of this
                    study at any time and will not be penalized for missing appointments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your sample tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or is inconclusive, you will
                    be called and send an encrypted email by a clinician who will recommend that you to self-isolate and
                    guide you to make an appointment with the UHS Tang Center for confirmatory. This confirmatory
                    testing is important because the saliva-based test has not been fully approved by the FDA for diagnosis
                    of COVID-19. The confirmatory testing is not a part of this research study and only exists to inform
                    clinical decisions about your care.
                </p>
                <p className='lead'>Benefits</p>
                <p>
                    COVID-19 does not present with symptoms in many individuals and features a varied incubation period
                    where individuals may still be infectious. Asymptomatic surveillance testing can be used to prevent the
                    spread of COVID-19 between asymptomatic individuals. By receiving asymptomatic testing in this study,
                    you will have the benefit of preventing the spread of COVID-19 from yourself to others. As a whole, this
                    study protects the campus community by minimizing the spread of COVID-19 between asymptomatic
                    individuals.

                <p className='lead'>Risks/Discomforts</p>
                <p>
                    Saliva sampling is not associated with any physical risks. You will be asked to avoid food or drink for 30
                    minutes prior to your appointments which may involve mild discomfort. Some individuals may
                    experience social or cultural discomfort with individuals watching them spit. We will maximize, to the
                    best of our ability, your privacy during sample collection. Additionally, there may be stigma associated
                    with a diagnosis of COVID-19. This can be minimized by only disclosing your personal results to
                    individuals you feel responsible to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality could be compromised; however, we are
                    taking precautions to minimize this risk.
                </p>
                <p className='lead'>Confidentiality</p>
                <p>
                    Your study data will be handled as confidentially as possible. If results of this study are published or
                    presented, individual names and other personally identifiable information will not be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To minimize the risks to confidentiality, we will not store any information regarding your test results
                    outside of the database ran by the licensed clinical lab. Any information entered into the scheduling
                    system or at the time of enrollment are kept on an encrypted server that will not be distributed to
                    anyone other than the diagnostic testing lab; local, state, and federal public health agencies such as the
                    California Department of Public Health; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other government
                    agencies involved in keeping research safe for people; and University of California staff who have
                    oversight over the diagnostic lab or the testing kiosks.

                <p>
                    When the research is completed, your data and samples may be saved for future research. You have the
                    option to opt-out of this. Your data will be retained indefinitely by the diagnostics lab in a HIPAA-
                    compliant database for legal requirements of their licensure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clinically relevant results, including individual results, will be disclosed to you if the diagnostics lab finds
                    that your saliva sample is positive for SARS-CoV-2 or is inconclusive.

                <p>
                    You will not be paid for participation in this study, nor will you or your insurance carriers be asked to pay
                    to participate in this study.
